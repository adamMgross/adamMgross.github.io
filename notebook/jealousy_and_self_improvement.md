title: On Jealousy and Self Improvement
---
I was listening to [this Made You Think podcast](https://madeyouthinkpodcast.com/12-rules-for-life-by-dr-jordan-b-peterson/) where the guys talk about [12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan B. Peterson](https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8/). They mentioned this quote from the book:

### Instead of comparing yourself against others today, you should only compare yourself against yourself yesterday.

I think this is a super valuable ideal to live by, especially in the age of social media where we are constantly seeing people's best, publicized, versions of themselves. This can lead to significant feelings of inadequacy and even depression, and I worry that my generation is too caught up in this. 

Focus on your own self self improvement! Identify opportunities for improvement, take action to make progress, and compare yourself against your own self yesterday. This will lead to constant, small steps of progress, and constant, small inklings of satisfation and pride. This is a positive feedback loop that compounds on itself.

[The podcast](https://madeyouthinkpodcast.com/12-rules-for-life-by-dr-jordan-b-peterson/) is a great introduction to these ideas, and I intend on reading [the book](https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8/) soon.
