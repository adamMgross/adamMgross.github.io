title: Focus on Your Main Duty
---
I read this passage in [The Art of Living by Epictetus](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Living-Epictetus/dp/1617207950), one of the fathers of Stoicism:

#### "There is a time and place for diversion and amusements, but you should never allow them to override your true purposes. If you were on a voyage and the ship anchored in a harbor, you might go ashore for water and happen to pick up a shellfish or a plant. But be careful; listen for the call of the captain. Keep your attention directed at the ship. Getting distracted by trifles is the easiest thing in the world. Should the captain call, you must be ready to leave those distractions and come running, without even looking back."

This rings true for me especially in regards to eating healthily and temperance. I need to be aware of the choices I make that put me in situations that make it hard to make the better decision. My "ship" is sailing towards long term health, and I need to make sure I stay close enough to the boat that I never miss its departures.
