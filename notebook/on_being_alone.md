*I spent two weeks travelling through Spain and Morocco alone, and had some thoughts on solitude:*
### Reflections on travelling alone/extended periods of time being alone:

Awesome. Amazing. So different. When you are with another person there are two main things going on that completely change your
life experience:
1. **Shared emotions/social awareness**: Being next to someone requires you to behave in accordance with their emotional space.
It is like an invisible dance. If they are upset, you must accommodate. If you are upset, they must accommodate. Same for the 
opposite end of the spectrum with happiness. There’s nothing wrong with this, but it requires significant attention. When you
are alone, you can devote all of that attention elsewhere. The best consequence of this is your increased ability for you mind
to wander deep down random thought paths. These are fun, rewarding, and build character. You notice things around you that you
might otherwise not have noticed. **NOTE: your phone must be kept away for this to happen!!!** Another consequence of being alone 
is that you can have a lowered regard for social norms and fashion. So I can wear the most comfortable clothing I have, and my 
awesome polarized dad glasses (my friends call them that because they’re so unstylish they make me look like a dad) without
care. Because strangers are just strangers and can become invisible very easily. Especially when they’re foreigners and don’t
speak English natively, or at all.
1. **Consistency vs. impulse and dynamicness**: Every day you make tons of decisions. When you are with other people you 
naturally make decisions that create a trail of rationality – this is how you can live easily with other people. The more 
predictable and understandable your actions, the easier you are to get along with, cooperate with, and coordinate with.
Consistent behavior is a fundamental thread in social relationships. However, our emotional states are incredibly inconsistent.
Also, the events that occur around us every day are crazily unpredictable. A lot of times there is tension between our 
endeavors to behave consistently and our endeavors to accommodate our inconsistent emotions in face of the unpredictable, 
practically random experiences – and it’s almost unnoticeable! Resolving this tension is not necessarily a bad thing, 
it is a key to happiness and a foundation of intelligence. However, being alone frees you from this conflict altogether. 
One time in Seville I changed directions about four times in the course of one minute, because I just felt each of those 
directional pulls and had no reason to not listen to them. About 30% of all the things I wanted to see throughout my
travels so far I didn’t see, because my flow just never led me to them. Sometimes it is more important to sit down and 
have a nice glass of cold water than to march on in the heat (In Morocco it was ~105 degrees). If you are not in a good
emotional state, even the most amazing experiences can be tainted, or even completely ruined. If your memories and 
experiences are a product of the intrinsic value of the experience AND your emotional state (I have a hunch that this is 
true and would love to hear what a psychologist thinks about this claim) then it is much easier to maximize this product 
when alone – UNLESS your emotional state suffers too significantly from being alone in the first place. People who fit 
this category are missing out on an amazing component of life. Furthermore, I believe the mobile device, internet connected 
millennial lifestyle is at odds with this mode of experience.
