[This discussion on mathoverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/25983/intuitive-crutches-for-higher-dimensional-thinking) is an interesting 
and helpful discussion about how to think in more dimensions than what we are used to (2 or 3). This comes from a math perspective and is clearly helpful
for mathmeticians but can really apply to everything. Here is a joke that motivates the conversation, but there is much more content in the link:

#An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are discussing how to visualise four dimensions:

_Engineer_: I never really get it.

_Physicist_: Oh it's really easy, just imagine three dimensional space over a time - that adds your fourth dimension.

_Mathematician_: No, it's way easier than that; just imagine R<sup>n</sup> then set n equal to 4.
