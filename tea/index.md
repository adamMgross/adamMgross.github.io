This page is an attempt to organize and consolidate all of the best teas I've come across. I mostly enjoy regular teas (caffeinated, non-herbal), and am in general most excited by Black teas, although I'm very enthusiastic about Pu-erhs and Oolongs as well. My trips to China and Japan, as well as the books [The Story of Tea: A Cultural History and Drinking Guide by Mary and Robert Heiss](https://www.amazon.com/Story-Tea-Cultural-History-Drinking/dp/1580087450/ref=sr_1_1?crid=OWUZFRM97NQF&keywords=the+story+of+tea&qid=1560181101&s=gateway&sprefix=aa+ba%2Caps%2C182&sr=8-1) and [The Book of Tea by Kakuzo Okakura](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486479145/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) have been crucial components in my cultivation of tea skills, experience, and mindset. Both books are highly recommended, as is the travel, of course.

While nothing can beat talking face to face with a good merchant and smelling and tasting tea before purchasing, I have found a few great online sources as well, each of which has yielded some of my favorite teas. In order to reduce clutter, some repeated sources are abbreviated: TT = [Tea Trekker](https://teatrekker.com), RBT = [Red Blossom Tea](https://redblossomtea.com), YS = [Yunnan Sourcing](https://yunnansourcing.com/pages/frontpage), WDC = [Wangdechuan Tea House](http://www.dechuantea.com/)
