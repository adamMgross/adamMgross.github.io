title: Adam's Reading List
---
Here is a list of books that I have enjoyed. This includes fiction an non-fiction, and it is roughly ordered by the recency of reading. I will also include a section at the end for books that I have yet to read, but intend to read in my life. There is a separate section of this website called [academic work](/academic_work) that contains the content I have read for my Middle Eastern History studies.
