title: Reading List
---
Here is a list of all of the books I have read in my life that I have enjoyed. This includes fiction an non-fiction. Since my interests are diverse, this list will be diverse. I will also include a section at the end for books that I have yet to read, but intend to read in my life. There is a separate section of this website called [academic work](/academic_work) that contains the content I have read for my Middle Eastern History studies.
