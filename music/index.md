I love music. I started learning the violin at 9 and switched to guitar at 10 years old. I was initially into Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and that whole field of guitar and rock. I quickly fell in love with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and they built me into the musician I am today. John Frusiciante, their guitarist from 1988 to 2009 is one of my idols and strongest sources of creative inspiration. I gradually learned bass over time, and grew to love funk and improvisation. I also grew up in the electronic, house, dubstep as well as rap eras, and have been exposed to everything that floated through the mainstream. My love of improvisation eventually brought me into Jazz by my junior year of high school, as I found a perfect bridge between Jazz and my funky RHCP self -- 70s Jazz-Funk Fusion. This catapulted me down a path from which I will never look back. I explored Herbie Hancock, Weather Report, Chick Corea, and those other guys and by the end of high school I decided to take up piano. Once I moved to Nashville to attend Vanderbilt University, I began to take lessons with Bruce Dudley, a Jazz Piano teacher at the Blair Music School at Vanderbilt. I have since then expanded my knowledge of Jazz, Improvisation, Music Theory, and Cacophony immensely. I have fallen in love with Jazz more than I ever imagined I would, and have found that the genre Bossa Nova is one of the most beautiful formats for creation in the history of mankind. I infuse all of these influences into my compositions, which I produce myself on Logic Pro X. These songs can all be found on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/adam-gross-6">my Soundcloud</a>, which can also be found at the bottom of this page. In general I would describe my music taste as a soup with a lot of jazz, a lot of funk, never losing that groove, with a good dose of house, rap, R & B, Soul, Rock, Blues, and a touch of spur-of-the-moment. So listed below are my self-curated spotify playlists from which I have developed and furthered my taste. There playlists available on both YouTube and Spotify (there is significant content overlap between them), click [here]() to skip to the Spotify Section
