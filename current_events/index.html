<p> This page is my news feed. I post here articles that I find interesting. For me, "interesting" DOES NOT mean "agreeable". I am a strong independent and value ideological diversity. I strive to expose myself to ideas that span the entire political spectrum, and am constantly re-assessing my political sentiments. I am consistently inconsistent. I have quit Facebook, because their news feed algorithms make me fear for my own mind's independence. One of the mantras of Machine Learning these days is that the quality of your data determines the quality of your algorithm. Thus I strive to maximize the quality of my data that I intake, and the rise of the internet has flooded our eyes with low-quality data. I feel it is my duty to sift through this sea of information and read and share the high quality information that I find. The links below hopefully achieve those goals. I welcome all thoughts and critcism via <a href="mailto:adam.gross.email@gmail.com">email</a>. An important note here is that these links will not be only new news. Old news is sometimes still very relevant and interesting. It is incumbent upon the reader to utilize the contextual information about each article in their analysis.</p>
