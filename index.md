# Adam Gross
Hey! Thanks for visiting my website. This website is intended to be a social-media-platform-independent digital social profile to share my personal interests and hobbies. If you like me or are like me, there will definitely be something of interest to you here.

* The [Music](/music) page has a description of my music taste, a collection of self-made Spotify playlists, and SoundCloud playlist containing all of my personal compositions.
* The [Reading](/reading) page has a list of my favorite books I've read, and top books on my reading to-do list.
* The [Photography](/photography) page is a gallery of my favorite photos I have taken.
* The [Academic Work](/academic_work) page contains all of the most interesting articles and books I read and the papers I wrote as part of my collegiate studies, mostly focused on history.
* The [Movies and TV](/movies_tv) section contains a list of all of my favorite movies and TV shows.

I have a very wide range of interests. My undergraduate studies were in Computer Science, Math, and History with a concentration in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to those academic areas, I also love all of the following (in no particular order):

* Jazz
* Philosophy
* Politics, especially Foreign Politics and Media Politics
* Acoustics, Electrical Engineering, Digital Audio Synthesis, Audio Recording, Audio Post-Production
* Theology
* Anthropology
* Behavioral Science
* Sports and Sports Analytics
* Entrepreneurship and  Technology Business Strategy
* Business Administration
* Logistics Management/Strategy
* Travel
* Nature Photography
* Surrealist, Impressionist, Art Deco, and related art

For me, *"interesting"* **does not** mean *"agreeable"*. I am a strong independent and value ideological diversity. I strive to expose myself to ideas that span the entire political spectrum, and am constantly re-assessing my political sentiments. I am consistently inconsistent. I have quit Facebook, because their news feed algorithms make me fear for my own mind's independence. One of the mantras of Machine Learning these days is that the quality of your data determines the quality of your algorithm. Thus I strive to maximize the quality of my data that I intake, and the rise of the internet has flooded our eyes with low-quality data. I hope that this website can help increase the availability of higher quality data on the web.

I will be continually adding new content as I come across it in my own life. I welcome all comments, questions, and contributions, so feel free to [email me](mailto:adam.gross.email@gmail.com) any time!

Thanks, Adam
