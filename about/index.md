I am currently a Software Engineer at Google in Venice Beach, California. My undergraduate studies were in Computer Science, Math, and History with a concentration in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to those academic areas, I also love all of the following (in no particular order):

* Jazz
* Philosophy
* Politics, especially Foreign Politics and Media Politics
* Acoustics, Electrical Engineering, Digital Audio Synthesis, Audio Recording, Audio Post-Production
* Theology, Religion
* Anthropology
* Behavioral Science
* Sports and Sports Analytics
* Entrepreneurship and  Technology Business Strategy
* Business Administration
* Logistics Management/Strategy
* Travel
* Nature Photography
* Surrealist, Impressionist, Art Deco, and related art
* Meditation and Mindfulness
* Hiking

For me, *"interesting"* **does not** mean *"agreeable"*. I am a strong independent and value ideological diversity. I strive to expose myself to ideas that span the entire political spectrum, and am constantly re-assessing my political sentiments. I am consistently inconsistent. I am an aware and skeptical user of some social media, and avid critic of technology that does not adhere to the concepts put forward in [digital wellbeing](https://wellbeing.google/) and [humane technology](http://humanetech.com/).
