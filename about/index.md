# About Me

Hey! Thanks for visiting my website! This website is intended to be a landing page for all things Adam Gross. If you like me or are like me, there will definitely be something of interest to you here. This site features both static information and new information feeds, ranging from my favorite books and favorite albums to my academic work, to a blog-style feed of thoughts I have throughout my day.

I have a very wide range of interests. My undergraduate majors are Computer Science, Math, and History with a concentration in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to those three awesome academic areas, I also love all of the following (in no particular order):

*   Jazz
*   Philosophy
*   Politics, especially Foreign Politics and Media Politics
*   Acoustics, Electrical Engineering, Digital Audio Synthesis, Audio Recording, Audio Post-Production
*   Theology
*   Anthropology
*   Economics
*   Sociology
*   Sports and Sports Analytics
*   Entrepreneurship and Disruptive Technology Business Strategy
*   Business Administration
*   Logistics Management/Strategy
*   Travel (which combines all of the above)
*   Photography (which combines all of the above)

So throughout this website you will find content covering any subset of these areas. There is no "main" page or main focus of this website, other than to provide interesting content for those who are interested. I will be continually adding new content as I come across it in my own life. I welcome all comments, questions, and contributions, so [email me](mailto:adam.gross.email@gmail.com) any time!

Thanks, Adam
